The Proficient Pythonista
=========================

Lessons in writing the very best Python code. A work in progress!

The focus of these lessons are high-level patterns and methods that go beyond beginner-level concepts. They draw from experience gained over 30+ years of programming, and a range of programming languages and paradigms, but are written without assuming the reader will have any knowledge of other languages.

To see things that are planned, have a look at the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/spookylukey/proficient-pythonista/issues>`_.
