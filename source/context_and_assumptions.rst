=======================
Context and assumptions
=======================

The lessons in this guide assume modern Python, with a modern set of tools.

This means:

- You have an automated test suite

- You will be using some kind of type checker like `mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_, or `basedpyright <https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/>`_

- You are going to use the type checker in your automated tests

- You are using some kind of modern editor or system that will provide immediate error checking feedback, preferably using the same type checker as above. My screen shots will be from Emacs, but you donâ€™t have to use that. VS Code will be fine.
